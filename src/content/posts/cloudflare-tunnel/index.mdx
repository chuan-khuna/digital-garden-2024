## Simple Cloudflare tunnel with dynamic domain

Suppose that we want to publish `localhost:3000`

```bash
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

## Cloudflare tunnel with fixed domain

### 1. Authenticate

```bash
cloudflared login
```

Then select domain from the browser prompt.

### 2. Create tunnel

```bash
cloudflared tunnel create <tunnel name>
```

**tunnel name**: The name of the service or group of services on your local machine

Example: `foo-services` = a tunnel for multiple projects

**Example output:**

```bash
> cloudflared tunnel create foo-services

# Tunnel credentials written to ~/.cloudflared/61dbf6c3-a7e3-4d1b-80e4-15a1d90fd374.json.
# cloudflared chose this file based on where your origin certificate was found. Keep this file secret.
# To revoke these credentials, delete the tunnel.
# Created tunnel foo-services with id 61dbf6c3-a7e3-4d1b-80e4-15a1d90fd374
```

`<tunnel uuid>.json` → UUID required for config.yml

### 3. Update config.yml

Create/Update config.yml file

```bash
# use zed editor
zed ~/.cloudflared/config.yml
```

Add content to file:

**Simple configuration (single domain):**

```yaml title="config.yml"
url: http://localhost:3000
tunnel: <tunnel uuid>
credentials-file: ~/.cloudflared/<tunnel uuid>.json
```

**Advanced configuration (multiple domains):**

```yaml title="config.yml"
tunnel: 61dbf6c3-a7e3-4d1b-80e4-15a1d90fd374
credentials-file: ~/.cloudflared/61dbf6c3-a7e3-4d1b-80e4-15a1d90fd374.json
ingress:
  - hostname: sub-1.themather.asia
    service: http://localhost:8100
  - hostname: sub-2.themather.asia
    service: http://localhost:4321
  - service: http_status:404
```

Tunnel id `61dbf6c3...` has multiple (domain → local service) mapping

⚠️ **Important:** The last row of ingress must be `service: http_status:404`

In the example file above, we map `sub-1` public domain to django 8100 and `sub-2` public domain to astro 4321.

### 4. Create domain mapping

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns <tunnel uuid or name> <host name>
```

You can create multiple domain mappings:

```bash
cloudflared tunnel route dns 61db... sub-1.yourdomain.com
cloudflared tunnel route dns 61db... sub-2.yourdomain.com
```

### 5. Start tunnel

```bash
cloudflared tunnel run <tunnel uuid/name>
```
